Club Joining request Application

Clubs tend to allow joining requests at the begining of each year

every sport has its own requests like age range, height, and weight

and since the clubs might not know if a child would be tall or not

I've made some functions to count the expected height and the body mass index which are important to know for athletes 

This Application should allow the user to make a request where he/she will have to provide some information

and according to the expected height and BMI it will suggest some sports that suit the applicant to choose from

after finishing, the app will save a copy of the Applicant's info in a file and send an e-mail to the parent to get his/her approval

the application should also have an administrator that can print all the applicants' info, modify, or delete them
